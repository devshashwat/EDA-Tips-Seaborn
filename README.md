# EDA-Tips_Seaborn

We've selected the tips dataset from teh seaborn library for our exploratory data analysis. 
We've tried to extract insight about the relationship between different factors, such as the day of the week, time of day, whether or not someone is a smoker, and their gender to whether or not they are a generous tipper with respect to the size of the party.
We've tried to use mdoern and functional graphs in order to extract and present these insights. 
We'fve also tried to use information from the workshops as it was relevant for the given dataset.
